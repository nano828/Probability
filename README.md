On average, the number of cards between the aces should be equal. In other words, the 4 aces divide the deck into 5 sets. On average, the size of those sets should be the same which means the set size = 52-4 / 5 = 9.6.

On average, the place of the first ace is 9.6+1 = 10.6.

We're going to show the same result using this simulation.
